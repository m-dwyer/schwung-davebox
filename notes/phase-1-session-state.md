# Phase 1 — Session Checkpoint (Bundles 1 + 1.5 + 1.6 complete)

**Saved:** 2026-05-15 → updated 2026-05-16 (Bundle 1.5 shipped) → updated 2026-05-16 (Bundle 1.6 shipped, end of session).
**Status:** **✓ BUNDLE 1 + BUNDLE 1.5 + BUNDLE 1.6 VERIFIED + COMMITTED on `phase-1-bundle-1`** (Bundle 1.6 = commit `eaa0af9`, not yet pushed at time of this checkpoint write). All recording scenarios pass: loop_start=0 (count-in + normal, melodic + drum), loop_start>0 (count-in + normal, melodic + drum), window-wrap held notes, TARP overdub, ROUTE_MOVE + ROUTE_SCHWUNG. Vanilla-Schwung fallback also verified for Bundles 1/1.5 (deployed v0.9.13 binaries; user confirmed pre-Phase-1 behavior; patched restored after). Bundle 1.6 is dAVEBOx-only (no shim changes), so the stock-Schwung fallback path is unaffected by it.

**Discipline locked-in for this refactor:** **NO main merges until the entire Phase 1 refactor is complete and verified end-to-end.** Bundle branches push to their own remote refs only; one coordinated mainline drop + patch regen + release at the very end. Stated 2026-05-16 — memory: `feedback_phase_1_no_main_until_done.md`.

## Commits on phase-1-bundle-1 (off main, pushed to `origin/phase-1-bundle-1`)

- `73295f0` drum mode — `computePadNoteMap` branches: drum tracks push lane `midi_notes`; right-half pads emit 0xFF (vel zones aren't note dispatch).
- `d3fb587` trackOctave — bake runtime octave shift into DSP padmap push; resync on Up/Down arrows + drumLanePage change.
- `f47c93e` session-view padmap gate + drum lane note repush.
- `2e540d9` single-buffer monitor when armed on patched Schwung — on_midi dispatches unconditionally; record-path inline-monitor gated on `!dsp_inbound_enabled`.
- `f822dfe` record-tick slot mechanism — `on_midi` snapshots actual hardware press/release tick on audio thread; record handlers read from per-(track,pitch) / per-(track,lane) slots.
- `b5c3fa7` docs: session-state checkpoint (mid-session).
- `a46bb3c` **Bundle 1.5** — count-in preroll capture (last 1/8 note window) + window-aware recording (drop `% clip_ticks` in record_note_on/off, drum_record_note_on/off, tarp_fire_step, finalize_pending_notes; widen drum bounds to `< loop_start + length`).
- `eaa0af9` **Bundle 1.6** — ARP IN during count-in: tick `tarp_tick` inside the count-in loop; sync=off preroll capture in `tarp_fire_step` (gate `count_in_ticks <= PPQN/2 && count_in_track == t && !tarp_sync`, snap_tick = `loop_start * tps`); count-in fire primes `current_clip_tick = loop_start * tps`, resets every TARP-on track's runtime (`master_anchor=0`, `pending_first_note=(held_count>0)`, `sounding_active=0`), and reschedules in-flight pfx events to `fire_at=0` so queued note-offs release voices cleanly without a broadcast panic.

(Earlier Bundle 1 commits `78f9275`, `000e30e`, `ac3c3c2` are the scaffold/initial-dispatch trio that landed before the session-state file was first written; they sit underneath these on the branch.)

## Commits on `legsmechanical/schwung:phase-1-inbound` (off main, v0.9.13 base, pushed to `fork/phase-1-inbound`)

- `a58f557f` shim pad-delivery insertion (existed pre-session).
- `7aa0a0e9` capability sentinel `shadow_inbound_pad_midi_active()` exposed via shadow_ui.

Builds: dist/davebox-module.tar.gz current. `~/schwung/build/shadow/shadow_ui` deployed to `/data/UserData/schwung/shadow/` on Move (includes phase-1-inbound commits).

---

## Architecture summary

**On patched Schwung** (`shadow_inbound_pad_midi_active` exposed):
- Pad press → shim delivers MIDI to dAVEBOx DSP `on_midi` on the audio thread.
- `on_midi` looks up `inst->pad_note_map[active_track][padIdx]` and calls `live_note_on / live_note_off`.
- JS `S.dspInboundEnabled = true` → `liveSendNote` skips `queueLiveNoteOn/Off` for note events on ROUTE_MOVE and ROUTE_SCHWUNG.
- Recording: JS still sends `tN_record_note_on / tN_record_note_off`. `on_midi` skips note-on when armed on ROUTE_MOVE (record_note_on inline-monitors); dispatches normally when armed on ROUTE_SCHWUNG (record_note_on doesn't monitor there).
- Capability signal: `tN_padmap` handler sets `inst->dsp_inbound_enabled = 1`. Survives DSP instance destroy/recreate (state load) because JS re-pushes on every `computePadNoteMap` recompute.

**On stock Schwung** (`shadow_inbound_pad_midi_active` undefined):
- JS path unchanged. `S.dspInboundEnabled = false`, no padmap push, DSP gate stays 0, `on_midi` (not called by shim) is dormant.
- Identical behavior to pre-Phase-1 builds.

**JS-side gate sites** marked with `PHASE-1: remove when patches upstreamed` for the eventual cleanup pass when the shim patches land in official Schwung:
- `computePadNoteMap` push (entire block).
- `liveSendNote` ROUTE_MOVE branch (note-event skip).
- `liveSendNote` ROUTE_SCHWUNG branch (note-event skip).
- `init()` capability detection.

**DSP-side gate sites** marked similarly:
- `on_midi` early-return on `!dsp_inbound_enabled`.
- `tN_padmap` handler's `dsp_inbound_enabled = 1` line.

## What's NOT done yet (resume here next session)

### Open work

1. **Bundle 1.6 scope-guard investigation (next).** Bundle 1.6 deliberately left `looper_tick`, `drum_repeat_tick`, `drum_repeat2_tick`, and SEQ-ARP (`arp_tick`) dormant during count-in. Need to evaluate whether each is a real omission (live drum repeats / SEQ-ARP-on-live-input should sound through count-in) or hypothetical (playback-side only, correctly dormant). User asked for this immediately after Bundle 1.6 lands.

2. **Bundle 2 — VelIn + drum velocity zones + Note Repeat audio-thread path.** Per the original Phase 1 plan. Currently these features live in the JS path which Bundle 1 suppresses for note events on patched Schwung. See `notes/phase-1-plan.md` for the bundle breakdown.

3. **End-of-refactor coordinated drop** — when ALL phase-1 bundles are done:
   - Merge `legsmechanical/schwung:phase-1-inbound` → `legsmechanical/schwung:main`, push fork.
   - Merge `phase-1-bundle-1` (+ later bundle branches) → `legsmechanical/schwung-davebox:main`, push origin.
   - Regenerate `patches/davebox-local.patch` via `git -C ~/schwung diff v0.9.13..main -- src/` and commit on dAVEBOx main.
   - Cut release (probably `0.5.0`+).
   - Do NOT do any of this mid-refactor — see `feedback_phase_1_no_main_until_done.md`.

### Already done (confirmed)

- ~~**Vanilla Schwung fallback test**~~ — **PASSED 2026-05-16.** Deployed v0.9.13 binaries from `/tmp/schwung-vanilla/schwung.tar.gz`. dAVEBOx detected `shadow_inbound_pad_midi_active` absent → `S.dspInboundEnabled=false` → pre-Phase-1 path. User confirmed: pad presses, recording, session-view clip-launch all work as before. Patched binaries restored after test (backups at `*.patched.bak` on Move).
- ~~**Bundle 1.5 (count-in preroll + window-aware recording)**~~ — **VERIFIED + COMMITTED + PUSHED 2026-05-16.** Commit `a46bb3c`. See CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` for user-facing summary.
- ~~**Bundle 1.6 (ARP IN during count-in)**~~ — **VERIFIED + COMMITTED 2026-05-16** (commit `eaa0af9`). User-verified the three scenarios it targets: loop_start=0 + sync=on hold-through-count-in, loop_start=0 + sync=off hold-through-count-in, and loop_start>0. Captured-but-cut-off symptom on initial deploy was traced to a `send_panic` broadcast at fire (flooded MIDI ring buffer on ROUTE_SCHWUNG); replaced with per-track event-reschedule-to-fire_at=0 and verified clean. CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` and MANUAL §Count-in pre-roll updated in the same commit.
- ~~**Commit the uncommitted slot-fix + session-view-gate + drum-lane-assign work**~~ — **DONE.** Five commits on the branch as listed above. All pushed to `origin/phase-1-bundle-1`.

## Bundle 1.5 — shipped (reference)

Bundle 1.5 (commit `a46bb3c`) folded two related fixes:

1. **Count-in preroll capture window.** Presses in the first 7/8 of count-in are monitored only; presses in the last 1/8 land at `loop_start * tps` when transport flips. Filter is in DSP `on_midi` (last 1/8 note = `count_in_ticks <= PPQN/2`). JS-side `recordCountingIn` gate dropped — DSP is authoritative on patched. `record_count_in` handler clears slot active flags so stale flags don't leak. Slot-mandatory rule on patched: record handlers `continue` if no active on_midi slot (drops filtered preroll presses).

2. **Window-aware recording.** Every recording path was collapsing window-anchored ticks with `% (length * tps)` before insertion, stripping `loop_start`. All sites — record_note_on/off, drum_record_note_on/off, tarp_fire_step, finalize_pending_notes — now treat `current_clip_tick` / slot snapshots as already window-anchored. Drum write/close-gate bounds widened from `step < length` to `step < (loop_start + length)`; drum wrap math returns to `loop_start` instead of 0 at window end. Unsigned-wraparound gate math for window-crossing held notes verified correct.

**Why folded into one commit:** the count-in preroll uses a synthetic tick = `loop_start * tps`; without the window-aware fix, that would be modulo'd by `length*tps` to 0 for `loop_start=length` clips. They're coupled.

## Device-test plan (run before merging)

Goal: ~1 hour of real-music playing on patched Schwung. Hit the things below. Anything weird that isn't on the "expected NOT to work" list is a real regression.

### Expected NOT to work (Bundle 2/3 territory — DO NOT flag as bugs)

These features still live in the JS path which Phase 1 suppresses for note events on patched Schwung. They'll be ported in later bundles.

| Feature | What's missing | Bundle |
|---|---|---|
| **VelIn (per-track velocity override)** | JS applies `trackVelOverride` in `liveSendNote` — now skipped for notes. `on_midi` dispatches with raw pad velocity. VelIn knob no-op for pad presses. | 2 |
| **Drum velocity zones** | Right-half pad presses still arm a zone in JS state, but the actual velocity hitting the lane is raw d2 from `on_midi`, not the zone-derived value. | 2 |
| **Note Repeat (Rpt1 / Rpt2)** | JS pad-press handler fires the repeat pattern. With JS note dispatch suppressed, repeats don't fire on pad input. (Repeats DURING sequencer playback still work — those run from DSP step-fire.) | 2 |
| **Count-in preroll chord capture** | JS captures notes during count-in via `pendingPrerollNotes`. With JS suppressed, preroll captures may not work correctly. | 3 |

### Expected TO work — verify these

- **Chord cohesion** — press 3-4 pads simultaneously; should sound tight (no late notes). This is the actual Bundle 1 win.
- **Single-note latency** — should feel snappier than pre-Phase-1.
- **TARP, NOTE FX, HARMZ, MIDI DLY on melodic** — `live_note_on` routes through the pfx chain so these effects apply to live pad input.
- **Melodic recording** when armed — records AND monitors, no doubles.
- **Drum recording** when armed — drum lane fires, records, no doubles.
- **Octave shift** (Up/Down arrows on melodic) — already verified, but re-confirm under real use.
- **Drum lane page paging** (Up/Down on drum) — already verified.
- **Track switching** — Shift+pad and Shift+jog both.
- **Step playback** — untouched DSP render path; should be unchanged.
- **External MIDI in via cable 2** (USB MIDI input) — separate `on_midi` path; should be untouched.
- **Looper capture** — `pfx_send` captures emitted notes; should work.
- **ROUTE_EXTERNAL output** — USB MIDI out; JS path preserved for that.

### Edge cases worth probing

- **State load / set switch.** Switch sets while dAVEBOx is open. DSP destroys & recreates the instance. The first pad press AFTER the switch may be silent — `pad_note_map` and `dsp_inbound_enabled` are reset, and nothing re-pushes `tN_padmap` until the user does something that triggers `computePadNoteMap` (octave shift, track switch, key change, etc.). If this happens, the fix is to add an explicit `computePadNoteMap()` call in the `pendingDspSync` completion path (after `restoreUiSidecar(true)`).
- **Schwung overtake exit + re-entry.** Does `S.dspInboundEnabled` survive a Shift+Back + re-enter cycle? Should, but worth checking.
- **Rapid chord stress test.** Tight succession of chord on/off events. Watch for stuck notes or dropped events.
- **Stock-Schwung fallback** (if a stock build is around). Confirm no regression on unpatched Schwung.

---

## Critical lessons learned this session

1. **Schwung host silently drops module-defined global set_param keys.** Only per-track-prefixed (`tN_*`) keys reliably reach DSP. Burned many cycles before discovering. Solution: piggyback signals onto an existing `tN_*` push (e.g. `tN_padmap` handler now also sets `active_track` and `dsp_inbound_enabled`). Memory saved at `feedback_schwung_drops_global_set_param.md`.
2. **DSP instance destroy/recreate (state load path) wipes runtime flags.** Initial JS pushes happen BEFORE the recreate, so any one-shot init push is lost. Solution: push on every relevant action so any recompute restores the flag. Memory: see `feedback_create_instance_loads_state` (existing).
3. **`host_module_set_param('debug_log', msg)` is unreliable in practice.** The DSP handler exists and `seq8_ilog` works internally, but JS-initiated calls were never observed reaching the log in this session. Don't trust this pattern. Memory updated.
4. **`shadow_*` JS functions ARE exposed to module JS context** despite being registered in shadow_ui's own JS context — confirmed by the corun pattern. Worth verifying if confused about scope.
5. **Recording double-monitor caveats are route-dependent.** ROUTE_MOVE: `record_note_on` inline-monitors (so on_midi must skip when armed). ROUTE_SCHWUNG: `record_note_on` does NOT monitor (so on_midi must dispatch even when armed). Different gates per route.
6. **JS dispatch path applies `trackOctave * 12` at dispatch time, not in `computePadNoteMap`.** Phase 1 must bake the offset into the DSP push to preserve the behavior. Leave `S.padNoteMap` itself unshifted so stock fallback still works correctly.

---

## Bundle 1.6 — shipped (reference)

Bundle 1.6 (commit `eaa0af9`) closes the "TARP + count-in" gap surfaced during Bundle 1.5 device testing. Three coupled changes:

1. **TARP ticks during count-in.** `tarp_tick` called per track inside the count-in inner while loop, then `arp_master_tick++`. Mirrors the stopped block; explicitly skips `looper_tick`, `drum_repeat_tick`, `drum_repeat2_tick`, and `arp_tick` (scope-guarded — to be re-evaluated next).

2. **Sync=off preroll capture in `tarp_fire_step`.** Gate: `!tr->recording && count_in_ticks > 0 && count_in_ticks <= PPQN/2 && count_in_track == t && !tr->tarp_sync`. When open, `snap_tick = loop_start * tps`. Sync=on doesn't need this — its grid-aligned first post-fire fire lands on step 0 naturally once Piece 3 below primes `current_clip_tick`.

3. **Count-in fire branch primes per-track state for clean handoff:**
   - `_tr->current_clip_tick = loop_start * tps` — fixes the symptom where the first post-fire arp note (sync=on) was missed by capture. `tarp_tick` runs at L6744 *before* the per-track tick advance at L6857 recomputes `current_clip_tick`, so without the prime the first fire reads a stale tick.
   - Every `tarp_on` track gets `sounding_active=0`, `master_anchor=0`, `pending_first_note=(held_count>0)`, `gate_remaining=0`, `ticks_until_next=0`. Without `master_anchor=0` the first post-fire `master_pos = arp_master_tick - master_anchor` underflows and picks the wrong pattern step.
   - In-flight pfx events get rescheduled to `fire_at=0` (NOT cleared, NOT panicked). The events were pegged to count-in's high `sample_counter` which just got zeroed; rescheduling lets the queued note-offs from count-in TARP gates fire on the next `pfx_q_fire` and release Move/Schwung voices cleanly.

**Why no `send_panic` at fire (initial deploy regressed):** The first deploy of Bundle 1.6 included `send_panic(inst)` at fire to defensively release voices. On ROUTE_SCHWUNG it broadcasts 2048 note-offs (16 channels × 128 notes) in one shot, which flooded the MIDI ring buffer and ate the first audible loop step. Replacing the panic with the per-track event-reschedule (which only emits the actual queued note-offs, not all 2048 channels-notes pairs) fixed the symptom and is the shipped form.

## Verification scenarios run this session

All against the latest tree, on patched Schwung, post-count-in:

| # | Test | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 16-step hold | ✓ | gate=372 ticks ≈ 15.5 steps (sub-step hardware precision) |
| 2 | Staccato | ✓ | gates 10-15 ticks ≈ 0.4-0.6 step (user's hand precision) |
| 3 | Chord cohesion | ✓ | 3-note chord, all on_ticks within 1 tick of each other |
| 4 | Drum simultaneous | ✓ | user heard tight, by ear |
| 5 | TARP+armed | ✓ | arp fired, notes recorded |
| 6 | Cross-clip-wrap | ✓ (incidental) | chord test: one note released at clip_tick=2 (post-wrap), gate=388 = 768 - 382 + 2 (correct wrap branch) |
| -- | Count-in path | ✗ (known) | gate=12.5 steps when 16 held — see Bundle 1.5 plan |
