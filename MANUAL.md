# The dAVEBOx Manual

dAVEBOx is an 8-track MIDI sequencer for Ableton Move. It runs as a tool module inside [Schwung](https://github.com/charlesvestal/schwung) and uses Move's pads, knobs, and screen. dAVEBOx generates no audio — every note it produces goes to Move's native instruments, Schwung's effect chains, or an external synth over USB-A.

# 1. Quick Start

## One-time setup

Before dAVEBOx can make sound, Move and Schwung need to receive on matching MIDI channels.

**Move** — set tracks 1–4 to receive on channels 1–4. Turn MIDI Out **off** on each (prevents echo loops):

| Move track | MIDI In | MIDI Out |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ch 1 | Off |
| 2 | Ch 2 | Off |
| 3 | Ch 3 | Off |
| 4 | Ch 4 | Off |

**Schwung** — set slots 1–4 to receive on channels 5–8. Set each slot's Forward Channel to **Auto** (not Thru):

| Schwung slot | Rcv Channel |
|---|---|
| 1 | Ch 5 |
| 2 | Ch 6 |
| 3 | Ch 7 |
| 4 | Ch 8 |

## Your first pattern

1. Load a Schwung set and open dAVEBOx.
2. You start in **Session View** — an 8-column clip grid. Tap **Note/Session** to switch to **Track View**.
3. Open the Global Menu (**Shift + Note/Session**), navigate to **Mode**, and set it to **Drum**.
4. Close the menu (Note/Session). The left 4×4 pads are now drum lanes.
5. Tap a lane pad on the left side — you'll hear the drum sound and that lane becomes active.
6. Tap **step buttons 1–16** below the pad grid to place hits for that lane.
7. Press **Play**. Your pattern loops.

## Add a melodic part

1. Switch to track 5: hold **Shift** and tap the **5th pad in the bottom row**.
2. The pads now play pitched notes snapped to the active scale.
3. Hold a pad and tap a step button — that step gets the held note.
4. Hold two pads and tap a step for a chord (up to 4 notes per step).

## Try the effects

Rotate the **jog wheel** to cycle through parameter banks. Stop on **DELAY**. Turn K3 (Rep) to 3 — each note now echoes. Turn K5 (Pfb) to +5 — echoes climb in pitch. These settings are per-clip: switch clips with the side buttons and each clip sounds different.

## Save

**Shift + Note/Session** → **Save**. dAVEBOx also auto-saves when you press Back (suspend) or Shift+Back (exit).

```

**Terminology used in this manual:**

| Name | What it is |
|---|---|
| K1–K8 | Eight knobs above the pad grid |
| Jog | Clickable encoder on the left. "Jog rotate" = turn, "jog click" = press |
| Volume | Encoder at top right. Master output only (passed to Move firmware) |
| R0–R3 | Pad grid rows, bottom to top |
| Side clip buttons (c1–c4) | Four buttons left of the pad grid |
| Step buttons (s1–s16) | 16 buttons below the pad grid |
| Back | Suspends dAVEBOx. **Shift + Back** fully exits |

## Switching tracks

There are no dedicated track buttons. To change the active track:

| Method | Where it works |
|---|---|
| Shift + jog rotate | Track View |
| Shift + bottom-row pad (1–8) | Track View |
| Tap any pad in a column | Session View |

The OLED shows a 1px box around the active track number (1–8).

## Two views

| | Track View | Session View |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Edit one clip in detail | Launch and arrange clips across all tracks |
| Pad grid | Plays notes or drum lanes | Shows the clip grid |
| Step buttons | Step pattern for active clip | Scene launchers |
| Jog rotate | Cycle parameter banks | Scroll scene rows |
| Note/Session | Switch views (tap) or peek (hold) | Same |

## The Global Menu

**Shift + Note/Session** opens the menu. Jog rotates through items; jog click enters edit mode; rotate to change value; click to confirm; Note/Session closes the menu.

The menu starts with the active track's settings (**Track [N] Config**), followed by global settings below a separator. Pads, steps, and transport keep working while the menu is open.

### Changing Key or Scale transposes your clips

When you edit **Key** or **Scale**, all of your melodic clips move with it:

- **While you turn the knob**, you get a live preview — the pads relayout and, if the sequencer is playing, you *hear* every melodic clip transposed to the candidate key/scale. Nothing is committed yet.
- **Click the knob to commit.** If any melodic clip has notes, a **"Transpose clips?"** prompt appears (jog to pick **YES** / **NO**, click to confirm). YES bakes the transpose into every melodic clip; NO leaves everything where it was. If no clip has notes, the click just applies the new Key/Scale with no prompt.
- **Backing out** (Note/Session, or turning back to the original value) cancels — nothing moves.

How notes move: changing **Key** transposes by the shortest distance (C→D up a step; C→B down one). Changing **Scale** reshapes each note by scale degree when the two scales have the same number of notes (e.g. Major↔Minor — the 3rd stays the 3rd), or snaps to the nearest in-scale note when they differ (e.g. into a Pentatonic). Harmonies and arpeggios follow the new key/scale in the preview too. Drum tracks are unaffected. Transpose is not undoable — the prompt is the safeguard.

---

# 3. Track View

The primary editing environment. Shows the active track's clip.

## Basic controls

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Pads | Play notes (melodic) or trigger drum lanes |
| Steps 1–16 | Toggle steps in the active clip |
| Side clip buttons | Switch clips on the active track |
| K1–K8 | Adjust parameters in the active bank |
| Jog rotate | Cycle parameter banks |
| Jog click | Toggle alt-param mode on banks that support it (label flips to alternate; a down-arrow blinks in the header). Switching banks or tracks reverts to primary params. |
| Up / Down | Shift pad octave range (−4 to +4) |
| Left / Right | Navigate clip pages (clips longer than 16 steps) |
| Loop (hold) | Enter loop view |
| Loop (hold) + jog | Adjust clip length ±1 step |

The OLED shows all 8 knob parameters and values. Touching a knob highlights its row. The LED below each knob lights when that parameter differs from default.

## Switching tracks while playing

While the transport is running, switching to a track with nothing playing or queued only auto-launches the focused clip when that clip is empty. A clip with notes or drum hits stays off until you explicitly launch it.

## Shift + step shortcuts

While holding Shift in Track View, available shortcuts light up on the step buttons:

The OLED also shows a compact shortcut overlay while Shift is held, so you can
check the major destinations without memorizing the full table.

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 2 | Open Global Menu at Global section |
| 3 | Edit the active track's sound source via co-run |
| 5 | Tap Tempo screen |
| 6 | Metro toggle (Count-In ↔ Always) |
| 7 | Open Global Menu at Swing |
| 8 | Drum: cycle right-pad mode (Vel/Rpt1/Rpt2). Melodic: toggle chromatic layout |
| 9 | Open Global Menu at Scale |
| 10 | VelIn toggle (Live ↔ Fixed 100) |
| 11 | ARP IN on/off (melodic only) |
| 15 | Double-and-fill loop |
| 16 | Quantize active clip 100% |

Steps 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 also work in Session View. The rest are Track View only.

**Mute + Play** (Track View): toggles metronome Off ↔ last non-Off state.

---

# 4. Session View

The 8×16 clip grid. 8 rows visible at a time; jog scrolls to all 16.

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Tap clip pad | Launch/queue that clip |
| Tap empty clip pad | Focus it for recording |
| Shift + clip pad | Launch and jump to Track View |
| Scene launcher (side) or steps 1–16 | Launch all clips in that row |
| Shift + scene launcher | Launch row at next bar boundary (ignores Launch Quant setting) |
| Jog rotate | Scroll scene rows |
| +/− | Scroll by 4 rows |
| Loop (tap) | Lock Performance Mode |
| Loop (hold) | Temporary Performance Mode |

Empty cells in a scene row don't affect their track — that track keeps playing whatever it had.

Mute/solo controls work the same in both views (see §12).

---

# 5. Sequencing

## Tracks, clips, and scenes

dAVEBOx has **8 tracks**. Each track holds **16 clips**. Each clip stores notes plus its own effects settings. A row of clips across all 8 tracks is a **scene**.

Clips on a track play one at a time. Launching a new clip replaces what was playing on that track only. Launching a scene swaps every track at once.

## Melodic vs drum

A track is either **Melodic** or **Drum** (set in Track Config). They share the same concepts but differ in layout and available effects.

| | Melodic | Drum |
|---|---|---|
| Pad grid | Plays scale-snapped notes | Left 4×4 = 32 drum lanes (banked A/B); right 4×4 = function area |
| Step pattern | One pattern per clip | One pattern per lane within each clip |
| Per-lane loops | No | Yes — each lane can loop independently (polyrhythm) |
| Available banks | CLIP, NOTE FX, HARMONY, DELAY, SEQ ARP, ARP IN, AUTO | DRUM LANE, NOTE FX, DELAY, ALL LANES, REPEAT GROOVE, AUTO |

**Switching Mode converts notes.** Changing Mode carries sequenced notes across all 16 clips into the new type. Only notes move — effects reset to defaults. Melodic→Drum shows a confirm dialog when the track has notes (drum-specific settings have no melodic equivalent). Empty tracks switch instantly.

## Step entry (melodic)

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Quick tap empty step | Activates with the last note played on pads, velocity 100 (or VelIn if set) |
| Quick tap active step | Clears it |
| Hold step ≥200ms (active) | Opens step edit |
| Hold step ≥200ms (empty) | Activates the step and opens step edit in one gesture |
| Tap multiple steps at once | Toggles each |

Steps beyond the clip's length show dark grey.

### Pad layout

Default is **In-Key**: only scale notes present, root lit in track color. **Shift + Step 8** toggles **Chromatic**: all 12 semitones visible, in-scale notes highlighted. **Up/Down** shifts octave.

## Chord entry

- **Pad-first:** hold one or more pads, then press a step. All held notes go into that step.
- **Step-first:** hold a step, then tap pads one at a time. Tap a pad already in the step to remove it.

Both methods support up to 4 notes per step.

## Step edit

Hold any step button to open the edit overlay. Edits apply to all notes in the step simultaneously.

**Melodic step edit:**

| Knob | Label | Function |
|---|---|---|
| K1 | Oct | Shift by octave |
| K2 | Pit | Shift by scale degree (or semitone if Scale Aware is off) |
| K3 | Leng | Gate length |
| K4 | Vel | Velocity |
| K5 | Nudg | Nudge timing (±1 step minus 1 tick). Step blinks when on-grid. Notes that cross into an adjacent step reassign on release. |
| K6 | Iter | Iteration — see below |
| K7 | Prob | Probability — see below |
| K8 | Ratch | Ratchet — see below |

**Drum step edit:**

| Knob | Label | Function |
|---|---|---|
| K1 | Leng | Gate length |
| K2 | Vel | Velocity |
| K3 | Nudg | Nudge timing |
| K5 | Iter | Iteration |
| K6 | Prob | Probability |
| K7 | Ratch | Ratchet |

Hold multiple steps to edit them all at once. While holding a step, Up/Down shifts the octave range for reaching higher/lower notes.

### Trig conditions: Iter, Prob, Ratch

Three per-step conditions that reshape when and how a step fires. Default for all is `--` (no condition).

**Iter (Iteration)** — gates the step to play only on certain loop cycles. Values: `1/2, 2/2, 1/3, 2/3, 3/3, … 8/8`. Example: `2/3` means "play on cycle 2 of every 3," silent on cycles 1 and 3. The cycle counter is per-clip and resets only on cold transport start (Stop → Play).

**Prob (Probability)** — per-step play chance, 0–100%. The roll is per-note: on a chord step set to 50%, each note independently has a 50% chance, so voicings vary naturally.

**Ratch (Ratchet)** — retriggers the step x2, x3, or x4 times within one step slot. Sub-hits are evenly spaced. Each runs through the full effects chain.

**How they interact:** Iter is checked first — if it says skip, no sub-hits fire. Prob rolls once per note; if a note passes, all its ratchet sub-hits play.

## Pages and loop view

Clips longer than 16 steps span multiple pages. **Left/Right** navigates pages.

Hold **Loop** to enter loop view — step buttons represent pages:

- **Track color** = page is in the loop window (pulsing = contains notes)
- **White** = start of a range selection (during hold+tap gesture)
- **Off** = outside the loop window

Three ways to set the loop window while Loop is held:

| Gesture | Result |
|---|---|
| Jog ±1 | Grow or shrink the loop from the end (beginning stays fixed) |
| Tap a page button | Loop runs from page 1 through the page you tapped |
| Hold one page button + tap another | Loop runs from the held page through the tapped page |

Notes outside the window are preserved — they play again if you expand the window.

## Live recording

Press **Record** to capture pad input into the active clip.

| Starting from | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Stopped | 1-bar count-in, then recording + transport start together |
| Playing, fixed-length clip | Records immediately at current position |
| Playing, empty clip (no length set) | Arms recording, defers to next bar boundary. Record blinks red while pending. |

Stop recording: press **Record** again (transport continues) or **Play** (stops transport).

Recording is always additive — existing notes are never erased. Clear the clip first (Delete + side clip button) for a fresh take.

**Count-in pre-roll:** notes pressed in the last half-beat of the count-in are captured on step 1.

**Track switching while recording:** switching tracks is free. Recording follows the focused track.

**What Play does from stopped:** resumes whatever was playing when you last stopped. On a fresh set, no clips are active, so Play alone makes no sound — start sound by launching a clip or switching tracks while playing.

## Undo

**Undo** button reverts the last destructive action (one level). **Shift + Undo** redoes.

Undoable actions: step/clip/lane clear, copy/cut/paste, hard reset, live recording, bank reset, loop double, bake, legato, scene operations, automation clears.

---

# 6. Clip & Lane Settings

The knobs control different things depending on which parameter bank is active. Rotate the **jog wheel** to cycle through banks:

- **Melodic tracks:** CLIP, NOTE FX, HARMONY, DELAY, SEQ ARP, ARP IN, AUTO
- **Drum tracks:** DRUM LANE, NOTE FX, DELAY, ALL LANES, REPEAT GROOVE, AUTO

This section covers the CLIP, DRUM LANE, and ALL LANES banks — these control the clip's timing grid, playback direction, and note transformations. Most of these changes are permanent and directly alter your sequenced notes (use Undo to revert). The remaining banks are covered in §7 (Effects) and §8 (Automation).

**Alt-params:** some knobs have a secondary function (marked **Alt** in the tables below). **Jog click** toggles between primary and alt — the label on screen flips and a down-arrow blinks in the header. Jog click again, switching banks, or switching tracks returns to the primary function.

### Resetting parameters

| Control | Result |
|---|---|
| Delete + jog click | Reset all params in the active bank |
| Shift + Delete + jog click | Reset all effect params across every bank (preserves ARP IN) |
| Shift + Delete + side clip | Hard reset clip: clears notes and all params |

## CLIP bank (melodic)

Controls the clip's timing grid, playback direction, and note transformations. **K1–K4 permanently change your notes** — use Undo to revert.

| Knob | Label | Function | Range | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| K1 | Res | Resolution — sets the step grid size for the clip. Rescales note positions proportionally. **Alt: Zoom** — adjusts the grid without moving notes. | 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1bar | 1/16 |
| K2 | Stch | Beat Stretch — each detent doubles (right) or halves (left) the clip. Blocked if notes would overlap. | — | — |
| K3 | Shft | Clock Shift — rotates all notes forward/backward by whole steps. **Alt: Nudg** — shifts at tick resolution (finer). | — | 0 |
| K4 | Lgto | Apply Legato — turn right to open confirm dialog. Rewrites every note's length to reach the next note. Undoable. | → (action) | — |
| K5 | InQ | Input Quantize — snaps recorded notes to the nearest grid position. Per-track. | Off, 1/64, 1/32, 1/16, 1/16T, 1/8, 1/8T, 1/4, 1/4T | Off |
| K7 | Dir | Playback Direction — controls the order steps are played. **Alt: RvSt** — Reverse Style (Step vs Audio). Audio swaps note-on/off during reverse motion for a tape-reverse feel. | Fwd, Bwd, PPf, PPb | Fwd |
| K8 | SqFl | Seq Follow — auto-scroll the step display to follow the playhead. | On/Off | On |

**Direction:** Fwd plays normally. Bwd plays steps in reverse. PPf/PPb are pingpong modes — the playhead bounces back and forth (endpoints play once per direction change). **Live recording only works in Fwd mode** — non-Fwd clips show a popup when you try to record, offering to bake the clip to Fwd first. Bake and Ableton export freeze direction into note positions and reset to Fwd. Audio reverse style uses a 2L pingpong cycle (endpoints play twice).

## DRUM LANE bank

Controls the active drum lane's timing grid, playback, and note transformations (see §9 for drum track basics). **K1–K3 and K5 permanently change notes** — use Undo to revert.

| Knob | Label | Function | Range | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| K1 | Res | Resolution. **Alt: Zoom.** | 1/32–1bar | 1/16 |
| K2 | Stch | Beat Stretch (one-shot) | — | — |
| K3 | Shft | Clock Shift. **Alt: Nudg.** | — | 0 |
| K4 | Lgto | Apply Legato — per-lane. Turn right to confirm. Undoable. | → (action) | — |
| K5 | Eucl | Euclidean — spreads N hits evenly across lane length. Hand-placed hits outside the pattern are preserved. | 0–length | 0 |
| K7 | Dir | Playback direction per-lane. **Alt: RvSt** (Step/Audio). | Fwd, Bwd, PPf, PPb | Fwd |
| K8 | SqFl | Seq Follow | On/Off | On |

## ALL LANES bank

Applies settings to all 32 drum lanes at once. **K1–K3 permanently change notes across all lanes.**

| Knob | Label | Function |
|---|---|---|
| K1 | Res | Resolution — sets all lanes to the same value. Permanently changes notes. Display resets after release. |
| K2 | Stch | Beat Stretch — applied to all lanes. Shows "NO ROOM" if any lane can't fit. Permanently changes notes. |
| K3 | Shft | Clock Shift. **Alt: Nudg.** Permanently changes notes. |
| K4 | Qnt | Quantize all lanes at playback (does not change stored notes). Display resets after release. |
| K5 | VelIn | Velocity input override for this track (same as Track Config VelIn). |
| K6 | InQ | Recording input quantize for this track. |
| K7 | Dir | Playback direction on all lanes. Display resets after release. **Alt: RvSt** for all lanes. |
| K8 | SyncRpt | Repeat Sync — controls first-fire timing for held repeat pads. On = wait for the beat grid; Off = fire instantly. Default On. |

---

# 7. Effects

Every note — sequenced, played live, or from external MIDI — passes through the same effects chain before reaching a sound source:

```
 LIVE INPUT ──> [ARP IN] ──┐
                            ├─> NOTE FX ─> HARMONY ─> DELAY ─> SEQ ARP ─> OUTPUT
 SEQUENCED NOTES ───────────┘
```

- **ARP IN** processes live input only. Sequenced notes skip it.
- After the chain, global **Swing** is applied.
- If Performance Mode is active, its mods apply last.

All effects are **non-destructive** — they transform notes at playback time without changing the underlying sequenced data. Returning a knob to its default leaves the clip unchanged. NOTE FX, HARMONY, DELAY, and SEQ ARP settings are **per-clip**. ARP IN is **per-track**.

## NOTE FX bank

Transforms every note's pitch, velocity, timing, and length.

| Knob | Label | Function | Range | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| K1 | Oct | Octave shift | ±4 | 0 |
| K2 | Ofs | Note offset (scale-aware: steps in scale degrees when on, semitones when off) | ±24 | 0 |
| K3 | Vel | Velocity offset | ±127 | 0 |
| K4 | Qnt | Quantize amount at playback | 0–100% | 0% |
| K5 | Len> | Fixed pre-gate note length. `--` = passthrough. Values are step-multiples; K6 Gate then scales the result. | --, .25, .50, .75, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 | -- |
| K6 | Gate | Scales note duration. Below 100% = staccato, above = legato. | 0–400% | 100% |
| K8 | Rnd | Pitch randomness (scale-aware). 0 = off. **Alt: algorithm select** — jog click to enter alt mode, then turn to choose Walk (accumulating ±1), Uniform (random within range), or Gaussian (clusters around center). | 0–24 | 0 |

On **drum tracks**, K1+K2 edit the active lane's MIDI note (K1 = ±12 semitones, K2 = ±1); K3–K6 apply per-lane.

## HARMONY bank (melodic only)

Adds harmonic voices on top of every note.

| Knob | Label | Function | Range | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| K1 | Oct | Octave voice | ±4 | 0 |
| K2 | Hrm1 | Harmony voice 1 (scale-aware) | ±24 | 0 |
| K3 | Hrm2 | Harmony voice 2 (scale-aware) | ±24 | 0 |
| K4 | Hrm3 | Harmony voice 3 (scale-aware) | ±24 | 0 |

## DELAY bank

MIDI delay generating rhythmic echoes of every note.

| Knob | Label | Function | Range | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| K1 | Rate | Delay time. **Alt: ClkF** — offsets the timing of each successive repeat. | 1/64, 1/64D, 1/32, 1/16T, 1/32D, 1/16, 1/8T, 1/16D, 1/8, 1/4T, 1/8D, 1/4, 1/4D, 1/2, 1/2D, 1/1, 1/1D | 1/8D |
| K2 | Lvl | Echo velocity level | 0–127 | 127 |
| K3 | Rep | Number of echoes. 0 = bypass. | 0–16 | 0 |
| K4 | Vfb | Velocity change per repeat | ±127 | 0 |
| K5 | Pfb | Pitch shift per repeat (scale-aware) | ±24 | 0 |
| K6 | Gate | Fixed gate for echoes. Off = natural length. | Off, 1/64, 1/32, 1/16T, 1/16, 1/8T, 1/8, 1/4T, 1/4, 1/2, 1bar | Off |
| K7 | Rtrg | Retrigger — new note-on drops in-flight echoes. Off lets tails overlap. | On/Off | On |
| K8 | Rnd | Pitch randomness on echoes (scale-aware). **Alt: algorithm select** — same options as NOTE FX Rnd. | 0–24 | 0 |

## SEQ ARP bank (melodic only)

Step arpeggiator running after Delay. Per-clip. Applies to both sequenced and live input.

| Knob | Label | Function | Range | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| K1 | Styl | Style | Off, Up, Dn, U/D, D/U, Cnv, Div, Ord, Rnd, RnO | Off |
| K2 | Rate | Arp rate | 1/32, 1/16, 1/16t, 1/8, 1/8t, 1/4, 1/4t, 1/2, 1/2t, 1bar | 1/16 |
| K3 | Oct | Octave range. Positive = above, negative = below. | ±4 (0 = Off) | Off |
| K4 | Gate | Note gate. Below 100% = staccato, above = legato overlap. | 1–200% | 100% |
| K5 | Stps | Steps Mode — how level-0 steps behave in the Arp Steps editor. | Mute (rests), Step (removed from cycle) | Mute |
| K6 | Rtrg | Retrigger — resets pattern on each new note and at loop boundary. | On/Off | On |
| K7 | Sync | Waits for next rate boundary before firing. Off = fires from anchor. | On/Off | On |

**Arp Steps editor:** jog click on this bank enters the editor. K1–K8 set per-step pitch offsets (±24 scale degrees). Pads are a step-velocity editor (8 columns × 4 rows). **Loop + pad** sets step-loop length (1–8). Jog click, jog turn, or Note/Session exits. State is per-clip.

## ARP IN bank

Live arpeggiator for pad input and external MIDI. **Per-track**, not per-clip. Does not affect sequenced notes. Available on melodic tracks only — drum tracks use REPEAT GROOVE instead (see §9).

| Knob | Label | Function | Range | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| K1 | Styl | Style | Off, Up, Dn, U/D, D/U, Cnv, Div, Ord, Rnd, RnO | Off |
| K2 | Rate | Arp rate | 1/32, 1/16, 1/16t, 1/8, 1/8t, 1/4, 1/4t, 1/2, 1/2t, 1bar | 1/16 |
| K3 | Oct | Octave range | ±4 (0 = Off) | Off |
| K4 | Gate | Note gate | 1–200% | 100% |
| K5 | Stps | Steps Mode | Mute, Step | Mute |
| K6 | Rtrg | Retrigger on each new note | On/Off | Off |
| K7 | Sync | Wait for rate boundary | On/Off | On |
| K8 | Ltch | Latch — arp runs after release. First touch of a new gesture replaces the latched set; additional presses add notes. | On/Off | Off |

**Latch shortcuts:**
- While holding pads with ARP IN active, tap **Loop** to toggle latch.
- **Delete + Loop** also unlatches.
- Tap **Loop with no pads held** (latch already on): clears the latched chord without turning latch off.

**Latch feedback:** latched pads stay lit white. The `Arp` indicator inverts on the OLED. The Loop button blinks at the arp's step rate while latched.

**Latch persists** across track/route/channel changes. Clears on: transport Stop, Delete + Play, and Session View entry (active track only). Muting silences latched output but preserves the latch.

**Arp Steps editor:** same as SEQ ARP — jog click to enter. State is per-track for ARP IN.

Quick toggle: **Shift + Step 11** flips ARP IN on/off using the last-used style.

# 8. Automation

## AUTO bank

Each of the 8 knobs controls its own automation lane — a recordable stream of CC or aftertouch data that plays back with the clip. Each lane can hold up to 1024 recorded points (at 1/32 resolution, smoothly interpolated between points) plus an optional resting value that the lane returns to at each loop.

**Assigning what a knob controls:** jog click to enter alt mode on this bank, then turn a knob to step through the target options: aftertouch (AT), any CC number (CC0–CC127), or — on Schwung-routed tracks with patched Schwung — Schwung chain knob assignments (Sch1–Sch8). Sch lanes automate the knob assignments configured on the track's chain slot. The assignment applies to the whole track — all clips on that track share it.

**Param Peek:** touch any knob to show its bank/context, target, value, and
route. AUTO lanes use human-readable targets where possible, such as
`Aftertouch`, `CC7 Volume`, `CC74 Filter`, `Schwung knob 5`, or
`No target assigned`. Move-routed AUTO lanes identify the target conservatively
as the current Move parameter target for that physical knob. Hold the knob to
replace the summary with lane timing detail: lane/clip, route, loop length,
resolution, and zoom.

**The "—" floor:** every knob starts at "—" (send nothing). Turn below 0 to reach "—"; turn up from "—" to reach 0.

**Setting the resting value (normal turn, no step held):**
- **Stopped** (or playing with no automation): sets the clip's resting value and sends it live.
- **Record-armed + playing:** records by latch overwrite (see below).
- **Playing, not armed:** transient live audition only — does not change the resting value.

**Loop reset:** when a resting value is set, the lane smoothly returns to it each time the clip loops. If the resting value is "—", the lane holds whatever value it ended on into the next loop.

**Step button display:** the last knob you touched shows its automation values across the step buttons as a brightness gradient (brighter = higher value, off = no value). The playhead step shows the track color.

**Knob LED states (this bank):**

| State | LED |
|---|---|
| No data | Off |
| Resting value set (stopped) | White |
| Has automation | Yellow |
| Record armed | Red (brightness = value) |
| Playback | Green (brightness = value at playhead) |

**Recording:** while record-armed and playing, turning a knob starts recording on that lane — it continuously writes the knob's current value at the playhead position, replacing whatever was there. It keeps writing even after you stop turning (holding the last value), loop after loop, until you stop recording. Knobs you don't touch keep their existing automation. Switching clips stops recording on the previous clip.

**Step-edit:** hold a step on this bank. Turn a knob to write a flat value at that step. Turn below 0 to clear that knob's point back to "—".

**Clearing (all undoable):**
- **Delete** (tap) opens the CLEAR AUTOMATION menu — check AT and/or CC, then CLEAR.
- **Delete + jog click** or **Shift + Delete + jog** clears all automation for the clip.
- **Delete + knob touch/turn** clears that one lane.
- **Delete + step** clears all lanes at that step.
- Clearing the clip (notes) also removes all its automation.

## Per-lane loops

Each automation lane can have its own independent loop — separate from the clip's note loop. This lets you create polyrhythmic automation: a 3-step filter sweep cycling over a 4-bar melody, an LFO-like pattern at a different rate than the drums, etc.

Lanes inherit the clip's loop length and resolution by default. Once you set a custom loop, the lane cycles independently using the global transport — it fires at the same time as the clip but loops at its own rate.

**Setting a lane loop (Hold Loop on AUTO bank):**

The last-touched knob is the active lane. All Loop gestures target it.

| Gesture | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Step buttons** | Set loop length by page (same as clip loop) |
| **Jog wheel** | Adjust loop length by 1 step |
| **Left / Right** | Change resolution (playback speed) — same data, faster or slower cycle |
| **Up / Down** | Change zoom (step grid density) — same time span, more or fewer steps |
| **Delete + Loop** or **Loop + Delete** | Reset lane to clip defaults (length, resolution, zoom all cleared) |
| **Shift + Step 15** | Double lane loop with data copy |

**Resolution vs zoom:**

- **Resolution** changes how fast the lane plays through its steps. At 1/8 resolution, a 16-step loop takes twice as long as at 1/16. The step LED display doesn't change — same data, different speed.
- **Zoom** changes the step grid granularity. Zooming in shows finer divisions (more steps, more pages). Zooming out shows coarser divisions (fewer steps). The total time span stays the same. Breakpoints stay at their exact tick positions — the grid moves around them.

Both are shown on the Loop config screen and the idle AUTO bank display.

**OLED display (AUTO bank idle):** shows the bank header with Sch/AT/CC badges, the active lane's knob label + real-time value, resolution + zoom indicators, an automation value graph (black background, white line with playhead cursor), and a lane-aware progress bar.

**OLED display (step held):** split-screen with compact graph (showing held-step position marker) above the progress bar, and the 8-knob step-edit values below the header. Active lane is highlighted.

**Step LED colors (AUTO bank):**

| Value | Color |
|---|---|
| No data ("—") | Off |
| 0 | Dim warm |
| Low | Yellow/orange (rising) |
| Mid | Orange/red |
| High–127 | Bright white |
| Playhead | White |
| Out of loop | Dark grey |

Steps with real recorded breakpoints blip briefly (~every 0.5s) to distinguish them from interpolated values.

**Pad colors (AUTO bank):** grayscale version of the note layout — root notes bright, in-scale notes grey, chromatic out-of-scale off.

**Undo:** lane double-fill, lane reset, Delete+step, live latch recording, and clear automation are all undoable (Shift + Step 1).

# 9. Drum Tracks

On a drum track, each sound gets its own **lane** — a separate step pattern with its own loop length, timing, and effects. Think of each lane as an independent mini-sequencer for one drum sound (kick, snare, hi-hat, etc.). A drum track has 32 lanes total, each assigned to a MIDI note that triggers a specific sound in the destination instrument.

The pad grid is split into two halves:

| Pad block | Contents |
|---|---|
| Left 4×4 | 16 drum lane pads. Tap one to hear its sound and select it — the step buttons then show that lane's pattern. The other 16 lanes are on bank B (see below). |
| Right 4×4 | Function area: Velocity zones (default), Rpt1, or Rpt2 |

The left pads show 16 lanes at a time. There are two banks — **A** and **B** — giving you 32 lanes total. The OLED shows which bank is active. Cycle right-pad modes (and banks) with jog click or **Shift + Step 8**.

**Velocity mode:** 16 zones from velocity 8 (bottom-left) to 127 (top-right). Pressing a zone sets the velocity for subsequent step taps. Drum velocity zones override VelIn.

To change which MIDI note (and therefore which drum sound) a lane triggers, use the NOTE FX bank — K1 shifts by octave (±12 semitones) and K2 shifts by single semitones. The OLED shows the lane's note name and number (e.g. `Pad: C3 (48)`).

## Step sequencing

Tap a lane pad to select it, then tap steps 1–16 to place or remove hits for that lane. The step buttons always show the selected lane's pattern.

**Capture + lane pad** selects a lane silently (no trigger).

## Per-lane loops (polyrhythm)

Each lane has its own loop length. Set with **Loop + jog rotate** on the active lane. Example: kick at 16 steps, hi-hat at 12, percussion at 10 — each loops independently against shared transport.

## DRUM LANE bank

Per-lane settings for the active drum lane. **K1–K3 and K5 are destructive.**

| Knob | Label | Function | Range | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| K1 | Res | Resolution. **Alt: Zoom.** | 1/32–1bar | 1/16 |
| K2 | Stch | Beat Stretch (one-shot) | — | — |
| K3 | Shft | Clock Shift. **Alt: Nudg.** | — | 0 |
| K4 | Lgto | Apply Legato — per-lane destructive one-shot. Turn right to confirm. Undoable. | → (action) | — |
| K5 | Eucl | Euclidean — spreads N hits evenly across lane length. Hand-placed hits outside the grid are preserved. | 0–length | 0 |
| K7 | Dir | Playback direction per-lane. **Alt: RvSt** (Step/Audio). | Fwd, Bwd, PPf, PPb | Fwd |
| K8 | SqFl | Seq Follow | On/Off | On |

Lane length: **Loop + jog rotate**. Lane MIDI note: NOTE FX K1+K2.

## ALL LANES bank

Bank 7 on drum tracks. Applies to all 32 lanes.

| Knob | Label | Function | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| K1 | Res | Resolution — sets all lanes to the same value. Resets display after release. | Destructive |
| K2 | Stch | Beat Stretch — atomic; "NO ROOM" if any lane can't fit. | Destructive |
| K3 | Shft | Clock Shift. **Alt: Nudg.** | Destructive |
| K4 | Qnt | Quantize all lanes. Resets display after release. | Non-destructive |
| K5 | VelIn | Velocity input override for this track | Per-track |
| K6 | InQ | Recording input quantize | Per-track |
| K7 | Dir | Playback direction on all lanes. Resets after release. **Alt: RvSt** for all lanes. | Per-lane |
| K8 | SyncRpt | Repeat Sync — controls first-fire timing for held repeat pads. On = wait for grid; Off = instant. | Per-track, default On |

## Note Repeat

Retriggers drum lanes at rhythmic intervals. Two modes: **Rpt1** (single-lane) and **Rpt2** (multi-lane).

### Right-pad layout (both modes)

```
   Row 3    [Gate 0] [Gate 1] [Gate 2] [Gate 3]    ← gate mask
   Row 2    [Gate 4] [Gate 5] [Gate 6] [Gate 7]    ← gate mask
   Row 1    [1/32T]  [1/16T]  [1/8T]  [1/4T]      ← triplet rates
   Row 0    [1/32]   [1/16]   [1/8]   [1/4]        ← straight rates
```

### Rpt1 (single-lane)

Hold a rate pad to retrigger the active lane at that rate. Velocity is pressure-sensitive. Switch lanes while holding without interruption.

### Rpt2 (multi-lane)

Tap a rate pad to assign it to the active lane (default 1/8). Hold a lane pad to repeat it at its assigned rate. Hold multiple lanes for simultaneous repeats. Velocity is pressure-sensitive per pad.

### Latching

- **Rpt1:** Loop + rate pad starts and latches. Hold repeat + tap Loop to latch. Press active rate or Delete + Loop to stop.
- **Rpt2:** Loop + lane pad latches. Hold lanes + Loop latches all held. Tap latched lane to unlatch. Delete + Loop stops all.
- **Tap Loop alone** (no pads held): unlatches all Rpt1 + Rpt2 on the active track.

Latched lanes stay lit cyan. Transport Stop clears all latches. Mute silences but preserves latch.

### Gate mask

The top 2 rows (8 pads) form a looping gate pattern. All 8 on by default. Tap to toggle. Per-lane, persists across saves.

**Loop + gate pad** sets repeat cycle length (1–8). **Delete + gate pad** resets that step's velocity scaling and nudge.

### REPEAT GROOVE bank

Available when a repeat mode is active. Per-lane, persists.

- **K1–K8 (unshifted):** velocity scaling per gate step (0–200%, default 100%).
- **K1–K8 (Shift held):** nudge offset per gate step (±50% of step interval).

**Delete + jog click** resets the groove for the active lane.

## Drum-specific copy/mute

- **Copy + lane pad** → tap another lane to paste. Destination MIDI note preserved. Shift + Copy = cut.
- **Mute + lane pad** mutes. **Shift + Mute + lane pad** solos. **Capture + lane pad** selects silently.

---

# 10. Scenes & Performance Mode

## Scenes

A scene is a row of clips across all 8 tracks. Launch with a scene launcher or step buttons 1–16 in Session View.

### Scene editing

| Control | Result |
|---|---|
| Copy + scene launcher → another row | Copy all 8 clips |
| Shift + Copy + scene launcher | Cut the row |
| Capture + scene launcher | Snapshot currently-playing clips into that row (skips tracks with no notes or already on target row) |
| Delete + scene launcher | Clear notes in all 8 clips |
| Shift + Delete + scene launcher | Hard reset all 8 clips |

## Performance Mode

Performance Mode captures a short loop of what's currently playing and lets you transform it in real time using a grid of effects. It works in Session View.

### Entering and exiting

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Loop (tap) in Session View | Lock — persists hands-free |
| Loop (hold) | Temporary — exits on release |
| Shift + Loop or Latch pad (R0-8) | Toggle latch mode |

While holding Loop to enter, press a **step button** to set capture length:

| Step | Length |
|---|---|
| 1 | 1/32 |
| 2 | 1/16 |
| 3 | 1/8 |
| 4 | 1/4 |
| 5 | 1/2 bar |
| 6 | 1 bar |

Hold Step 16 + a length pad for the triplet variant of that length.

### Per-track inclusion

Each track's **Looper** flag (Track Config) controls whether it feeds Performance Mode. While locked, touch K1–K8 to toggle each track's Looper (knob LED = track color when on, off when off).

### The mod grid

```
   R3   Wild mods       — cyan
   R2   Vel/Gate mods   — yellow
   R1   Pitch mods      — magenta (melodic only, bypassed on drums)
   R0   Length / Hold / Sync / Latch controls
```

With **Latch on**, tapping a mod pad toggles it on or off — it stays active until you tap it again. With **Latch off**, mods are only active while you hold the pad. You can combine both: latched mods stay active while you hold additional pads for momentary effects on top. Pressing a lit pad always turns that mod off.

### R0 — controls

| Pad | Function |
|---|---|
| 1–5 | Capture lengths: 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 bar |
| 6 | Hold — loop persists when you release a length pad |
| 7 | Sync — clock-aligned capture on/off |
| 8 | Latch — sticky mod mode on/off |

### R1 — Pitch mods (magenta, melodic only)

| Pad | Name | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Oct Up | Alternating octave up / original |
| 2 | Oct Down | Alternating octave down / original |
| 3 | Scale Up | +1/+2/+3 scale degrees across 3 cycles, resets |
| 4 | Scale Down | −1/−2/−3 across 3 cycles |
| 5 | Fifth | Ascending fifths pattern |
| 6 | Tritone | 4th, 6th, octave+2nd across 4 cycles |
| 7 | Drift | ±1 scale degree random walk, accumulates to ±6 |
| 8 | Storm | Random ±6 scale degrees per note per play — chaotic but in key |

### R2 — Velocity/gate mods (yellow, all tracks)

| Pad | Name | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Decrescendo | Velocity ×0.85 per cycle |
| 2 | Swell | 16-cycle triangle wave |
| 3 | Crescendo | Velocity ×1.15 per cycle |
| 4 | Pulse | Even cycles full, odd cycles 20% |
| 5 | Sidechain | −15% velocity per successive note in cycle |
| 6 | Staccato | Gates to 1/8 of loop length |
| 7 | Legato | Gates to full loop length |
| 8 | Ramp Gate | Gate ramps up across notes |

### R3 — Wild mods (cyan)

| Pad | Name | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Half Time | Every other cycle suppressed |
| 2 | 3 Skip | Every third cycle suppressed |
| 3 | Phantom | Ghost note 1 octave below, quarter velocity |
| 4 | Sparse | ~50% chance each note suppressed |
| 5 | Glitch | ±2 scale degree random shift per note |
| 6 | Stagger | Notes offset by +0, +1, +2… scale degrees |
| 7 | Shuffle | Pitch/hit order randomized each cycle |
| 8 | Backwards | Pitch/hit order reversed each cycle |

### Presets

Step buttons 1–16 are preset slots. Tap to recall (replaces sticky mods). Hold ~0.75s to save. Delete + step clears.

**Factory presets (1–8):**

| Slot | Name | Mods |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Float | Scale Up + Legato |
| 2 | Sink | Oct Down + Decrescendo + Staccato |
| 3 | Heartbeat | Pulse + Half Time |
| 4 | Fairy Dust | Storm + Swell + Sparse |
| 5 | Robot | Tritone + Pulse + 3 Skip |
| 6 | Dissolve | Drift + Decrescendo + Phantom |
| 7 | Chaos | Storm + Glitch + Backwards |
| 8 | Lift | Scale Up + Crescendo + Ramp Gate |

Slots 9–16 are user slots (empty by default).

### Loop control

- Press a different length pad to queue a new capture (finishes current cycle first).
- Press the same length pad to immediately recapture.
- Switching to Track View exits Performance Mode but preserves mod state.

Latched mods, latch mode, user presets, and the recalled slot persist across saves.

# 11. Bake, Live Merge & Export

## Bake

**Capture** button. Bake renders a clip's effects (NOTE FX, HARMONY, DELAY, SEQ ARP) into permanent note data, then resets the effects to defaults. The result sounds the same without any effects applied — useful for layering new effects on top, or for freezing a specific sound.

### Melodic bake (Track View)

Tap **Capture** → two dialogs:
1. Loop count: 1x / 2x / 4x
2. Wrap tails? Yes / No (Yes wraps echoes past clip end back to the beginning for seamless loops)

Full chain runs: NOTE FX → HARMONY → DELAY → SEQ ARP. Trig conditions (Iter/Prob/Ratch) are applied per the loop count — the baked result embodies whatever pattern they produced.

### Drum bake (Track View)

Tap **Capture** → three dialogs:
1. Clip / Lane (Clip = all lanes with full chain; Lane = active lane only, no pitch transforms)
2. Loop count: 1x / 2x / 4x
3. Wrap tails? Yes / No

### Scene bake (Session View)

Tap **Capture** → pick a target row (tap scene launcher or step 1–16). Then loop count and wrap tails. Each track runs its per-clip bake. Empty clips are skipped.

Alternative: **Sample + scene launcher** goes directly to the confirm dialog.

## Live Merge

Live Merge records the actual output of all 8 tracks simultaneously as they play — capturing a live performance, effects and all, into new clips.

| Step | Control |
|---|---|
| Arm | Session View, tap **Sample** |
| Capture starts | Next bar boundary (or on transport start) |
| Stop | Tap **Sample** again (finalizes at next page boundary) |
| Auto-stop | 256 steps (max clip length) |
| Place | After stop, tap a scene row to commit |
| Cancel | Tap **Capture** instead of a row |

Tracks that captured notes overwrite their clip at the target row. Tracks that captured nothing leave the existing clip untouched.

## Export to Ableton Live

**Global Menu → Export to Ableton.** Writes an `.ablbundle` that desktop Live opens directly (then Save As .als).

Requirements: transport must be stopped. Confirm dialog appears.

The bundle lands at `/data/UserData/schwung/davebox-exports/<set name>-<date>.ablbundle`. Retrieve via SFTP. Opens in Live as 8 MIDI tracks × 16 scene slots with tempo and key.

**Track instruments follow routing:** Move-routed tracks get the actual Move instrument with its preset and color. Schwung-routed get a placeholder Drift. External-routed get a placeholder Drift.

**Notes are baked** — each clip exports "what you hear" with effects rendered. Drum clips flatten per-lane polymeters to their least common multiple. Randomized clips export 8 cycles of variations. Delay echoes wrap for seamless loops.

The bundle is self-contained — samples are included. Requires Live 12.1+ for Move Drum Racks. Export is one-way.

---

# 12. Editing & Mixing

## Copy, cut, paste

The clipboard stays live after paste — paste to multiple destinations from one source. Clipboard clears when you release Copy. **Cut = Shift + Copy** (source clears after first paste).

| Level | Copy gesture | Paste gesture |
|---|---|---|
| Step | Copy + source step → destination step | Same clip only |
| Clip | Copy + side clip button (Track View) or clip pad (Session View) | Press destination clip |
| Scene row | Copy + scene launcher | Press another scene launcher |
| Drum lane | Copy + lane pad → destination lane | MIDI note preserved |
| Drum clip | Copy + side clip button (drum) → destination | All 32 lanes; MIDI notes preserved |

## Clear and reset

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Delete + step | Clear that step |
| Delete + side clip button | Clear notes (structure survives) |
| Shift + Delete + side clip | Hard reset — notes and all params |
| Delete + lane pad (drum) | Clear lane notes |
| Shift + Delete + lane pad | Hard reset lane (MIDI note preserved) |
| Delete + jog click | Reset active bank params |
| Shift + Delete + jog click | Reset all play-FX (preserves ARP IN) |
| Delete + clip pad (Session) | Delete clip |
| Delete + scene launcher | Clear notes in row |
| Shift + Delete + scene launcher | Hard reset row |

## Mute and solo

| View | Mute | Solo |
|---|---|---|
| Track View | Mute button | Shift + Mute |
| Session View | Mute + clip pad | Shift + Mute + clip pad |
| Drum lanes | Mute + lane pad | Shift + Mute + lane pad |

**Delete + Mute** clears all mutes and solos.

Mute and solo are mutually exclusive per track/lane. Track mute silences sequenced notes and latched output, but held live pads still monitor through.

### Mute/solo snapshots

16 slots. In Session View, hold **Mute** and step buttons light (dark grey = empty, yellow = saved).

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Mute + hold step ~0.75s | Save |
| Mute + tap lit step | Recall |
| Mute + Delete + step | Clear slot |

Snapshots persist across reboots.

## Volume

The Volume encoder controls master output only (passed to Move firmware). Per-track volume is not available in dAVEBOx — adjust gain on the destination (Move mixer or Schwung chain).

---

# 13. MIDI Routing

## Default setup

- **Tracks 1–4** → channels 1–4 → Move's native instruments
- **Tracks 5–8** → channels 5–8 → Schwung slots 1–4

Requires Move and Schwung configured per §1.

## Per-track settings (Track Config)

- **Channel** — MIDI channel 1–16 (default: track N = channel N)
- **Route** — Move, Schwung, or External (USB-A output)

## External MIDI input

External MIDI from a USB-A controller routes to the active track. Filter by channel in Global Menu (MIDI In: All or 1–16). dAVEBOx rechannelizes incoming MIDI to the active track's channel.

## Live effects on external input

| Route | Live effects |
|---|---|
| Schwung | Full chain applies |
| Move | Chain bypassed (would cause feedback loop) |
| External | Full chain applies; output goes via USB-A |

## External MIDI output

When Route = External, all MIDI goes out via USB-A: sequencer, live pads, external echo, effects, ARP IN, Performance Mode. Multiple tracks can route External for multi-timbral setups.

**Transport Stop** sends note-offs and clears ARP IN latches on all tracks. **Delete + Play (stopped)** sends MIDI panic on all channels and clears Rpt1, Rpt2, and ARP IN latches. **Delete + Play (running)** deactivates all clips and clears latches.

## CC and aftertouch output

The AUTO bank lanes output CC, aftertouch, or Schwung chain knob (Sch) data at 1/32 resolution with smooth interpolation. On External-routed tracks, CC/AT output goes via USB-A. Sch lanes send CC 102-109 on the internal Schwung MIDI path to control chain knob assignments (requires patched Schwung). Aftertouch can also be recorded live via pad pressure when the track's AftTch setting is enabled (see §14 Track Config).

---

# 14. Global Settings & Persistence

## Track Config

Shown at the top of the Global Menu for the active track. Updates live if you switch tracks.

| Entry | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Channel | 1–16 | MIDI channel |
| Route | Move, Schwung, External | Output routing |
| Mode | Melodic, Drum | Converts notes when switched |
| VelIn | Live, 1–127 | Live = raw velocity. Fixed value overrides all input velocity. |
| Looper | On, Off | Whether track feeds Performance Mode |
| AftTch | Off, Poly, Channel | Pad-pressure aftertouch (melodic tracks only). Poly sends individual pressure per note; Channel sends one pressure value for the whole track. Move-routed tracks only offer Off/Poly. Default Off. |
| Edit Sound... | Action | Open the active route's native sound editor. |

### Edit Sound

Edit Sound edits the active track's sound source from within Overture: Schwung-routed tracks open the matching Schwung chain editor slot, and Move-routed tracks open Move's native preset/device editor. The sequencer keeps running while co-run gives the OLED and navigation controls to the native editor. Before handoff, Overture shows the target route or a route problem such as `NO SLOT`, `MOVE CH>4`, or `CO-RUN UNAVAILABLE`.

## Global settings

| Item | Values | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Metro | Off, Cnt-In, Play, Always | — | Metronome timing |
| Metro Vol | 0–150% | 100% | |
| Route Check | — | — | Shows expected Move/Schwung routes and detected Schwung slot status. |
| Tap Tempo | — | — | Full-screen tap interface. Pad taps calculate BPM. Jog ±1 BPM. |
| BPM | 40–250 | — | |
| Key | C through B | — | |
| Scale | Major, Minor, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Locrian, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor, Pentatonic Major, Pentatonic Minor, Blues, Whole Tone, Diminished | — | |
| Scale Aware | On, Off | On | Scale-aware params step in scale degrees instead of semitones |
| Launch Quant | Now, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1-bar | Now | Now = clips start immediately when launched. Other values wait for the next beat boundary. |
| MIDI In | All, 1–16 | All | External input channel filter |
| Swing Amt | 50–75% | 50% | 50% = no swing, 66% = triplet swing |
| Swing Res | 1/16, 1/8 | 1/16 | Which positions are affected |
| Beat Markers | On, Off | On | Dim markers on steps 1, 5, 9, 13 |
| Clear Session | — | — | Resets entire instance (confirm dialog) |
| Save state | — | — | Confirm, then write a snapshot |
| Quit | — | — | Save and exit |

## Save states (snapshots)

Up to **16 snapshots** per set — full state backups stamped with date/time.

- **Save state** (Global Menu) asks for confirmation, then writes a new snapshot. When 16 exist, a picker opens to choose which to overwrite.
- **Load state** opens a list (newest first). Jog to select, click to confirm. Loading discards unsaved changes.
- Snapshots belong to the set. **Clear Session does not delete snapshots.**
- After a format-changing update, old snapshots are marked `(old)` and can be removed.

## Version compatibility

If you load a set that was saved by an older dAVEBOx version, a dialog appears:

> **Incompatible State** — Session incompatible with current dB ver. Erase and proceed?

- **Yes** — erases the old state and starts with a clean session.
- **No** (default) / **Back** — exits the module. The old state file is preserved so you can back it up or downgrade.

## What persists per set

Auto-saves on suspend (Back) and exit (Shift+Back / Quit).

- All note data, per-clip effects, CLIP/DRUM LANE params, CC automation
- Track settings: channel, route, mode, octave, VelIn, Looper, AftTch
- Per-track active bank
- Global settings (BPM, key, scale, swing, launch quant, metro, etc.)
- Mute/solo state and all 16 snapshots
- ARP IN state (latch clears on Stop/Delete+Play/Session entry but persists across track switches)
- Performance Mode presets, latched mods
- Note Repeat gate masks, grooves, per-lane rates

## Set duplication

Duplicating a Move set via the native set page inherits dAVEBOx state:
- **1 parent found:** silent auto-inherit
- **0 parents:** blank start
- **2+ candidates:** picker dialog

## Cleanup

When you delete a Move set, dAVEBOx automatically removes its own saved data for that set the next time it launches.

## Limitations

| Limitation | Notes |
|---|---|
| External MIDI on Move-routed tracks bypasses the effects chain | Would cause feedback loop. Use Schwung routing for effects on external input. |
| Volume encoder is master-only | Per-track volume: adjust on destination. |
| CC automation lanes are not swung | By design — keeps automation on the grid. |
| Powering off from within dAVEBOx causes a brief hang | — |
