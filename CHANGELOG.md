# Changelog

All notable changes to dAVEBOx are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). Add entries to
`[Unreleased]` as user-facing changes land; `scripts/cut_release.sh` finalizes
the section into a versioned heading at release time.

## [Unreleased]

### Performance / UX
- **Lazy drum clip allocation.** Drum clips are now allocated per-track on drum mode entry instead of inline in every track. Default (1 drum track): ~7.5MB vs 60MB previously. No cap, no behavioral change.

### Fixes
- **Empty drum→melodic track conversion now reliably flips pad mode.** Previously, converting an empty drum track to melodic left DSP in drum mode (pads showed melodic layout but right half acted as velocity zones). Fixed by adding a get_param flush barrier for the empty-track path.
- **Incompatible state files prompt before erasing.** When loading a set saved by an older dAVEBOx version, a confirm dialog asks before wiping. "No" exits the module with the file preserved.

## [1.0b] — 2026-05-29
### Features
- **Per-clip / per-lane playback direction (Dir knob on CLIP and DRUM LANE banks).** Four modes: Forward, Backward, Pingpong-forward, Pingpong-backward. Mix directions across drum lanes freely. Bake and Ableton export honor direction — output is a forward-playing clip with notes rearranged to match directional playback.
- **Audio-reverse playback style (alt-mode on Dir knob).** Flip between Step (default) and Audio — in Audio mode, notes play "tape-reversed" during reverse motion. Pingpong + Audio gives fugue-machine-style one-forward + one-reversed cycle per note.
- **NOTE FX Len knob (K5) — non-destructive fixed length.** Per-clip (melodic) or per-lane (drum) fixed pre-gate length. Values: -- (passthrough), .25, .50, .75, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 steps. Applied at playback, bake, and export.
- **Lgto (Legato) one-shot action on CLIP K8 / DRUM LANE K8.** Destructive rewrite: each note's gate extends to the next note's start. Undoable.
- **HARMONY bank: Hrm3 added, Unison removed.** Three harmony intervals (Hrm1/Hrm2/Hrm3) at ±24 semitones each. Scale-aware when Scale Aware is on.
- **Per-step trig conditions: Iter, Prob (was "Random"), and Ratchet.** Hold a step for the overlay. Iter gates steps on loop-cycle predicates (1/2 through 8/8). Prob rolls per-note at fire time (0–100%). Ratchet retriggers x2–x4 within one step. Applied across live playback, bake, and export.
- **Bank alt-params toggle with jog-click instead of Shift.** Sticky toggle with a flashing arrow icon. Works on CLIP, DELAY, AUTOMATION, DRUM LANE, REPEAT GROOVE, ALL LANES. AUTOMATION alt = ASSIGN mode.
- **CC automation latch overwrite recording.** Turn a knob to engage — continuously overwrites the lane along the playhead. Keeps writing even after you stop turning. Per-loop decimation keeps lanes clean.
- **Melodic pad pressure → aftertouch (Track Config → AftTch).** Off / Poly / Channel modes. Recorded into clips and plays back as interpolated automation.
- **AUTOMATION bank (renamed from CC PARAM).** Per-clip resting values with opt-in "—" floor, 1024-point cap, AT/CC type per knob, step LED gradient, knob-ring status colors, knob acceleration.
- **Clear Automation is undoable.** Undo also restores automation lost during clip clear/copy/cut/bake/row operations.
- **Save states (snapshots).** Up to 16 timestamped snapshots per set via Global Menu. Save, load (with confirm), and overwrite at cap.
- **Export to Ableton Live (.ablbundle).** Full 8-track × 16-scene export with baked clip notes, drum polymeter flatten, route-aware instruments, self-contained samples, multi-cycle bake for randomized/delayed clips, and progress display.
- **Track type conversion carries notes (Track Config → Mode).** Drums↔Keys translates sequenced notes. Empty tracks convert instantly.
- **Co-run improvements.** Edit Slot knobs drive chain params. Edit Synth reliable track landing + clean LED handoff. Co-run exit is Menu; Back navigates within the editor. Drum pad hold works for Move's per-drum editor. Side clip buttons lit solid white in Edit Synth.
- **Move-native knob spin stutters less in Edit Synth.** Shim coalesces CC detents per audio frame.
- **ARP IN bank reset (Delete+jog on ARP IN bank).** Resets all TARP params in one gesture.
- **Arp Steps overlay.** Jog-click on SEQ ARP or ARP IN for persistent step-interval editing (±24 scale degrees per step) + step-vel level editor. Loop+pad sets pattern loop length (1–8). Note/Session exits overlay. Pads suppressed during overlay.
- **Sub-bar launch quant preserves playhead phase.** 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 phase-align into the new clip instead of resetting to step 0.
- **CLIP, DRUM LANE, and ALL LANES knob banks rearranged.** Consistent layout across banks. ALL LANES gains K1=Res (all 32 lanes) and K7=Dir (all lanes).
- **Melodic and drum NOTE FX banks rearranged.** Drum NOTE FX now hosts the per-lane MIDI-note editor (K1+K2).
- **Recording blocked in non-Forward direction.** Shows popup; bake first to freeze direction, then record.
- **Copy/cut carries Dir and RvSt to destination.**
- **Loop button blinks at ARP IN rate while track is latched.**
- **Delay Retrig knob (DELAY K7).** New note-on drains in-flight echoes (default ON). Clock Feedback moves to Shift+K1.
- **Shift+side row in Session View queues bar-quantized scene launch.**
- **Hold empty melodic step → auto-activates with lastPlayedNote and opens step edit.**
- **Tap Loop alone (drum track) unlatches all repeats on that track.**

### Fixes
- **Clear Session fully resets all state.** Global settings, mute/solo, snapshots, CC assigns, VelIn, JS state, TARP, channel, pad octave, route, looper all reset to factory defaults.
- **Global params persist on change.** Key, scale, BPM, metronome, etc. save immediately instead of only on suspend.
- **Pad drop self-heal.** Periodic readback detects and corrects stale pad_note_map entries within ~50ms.

### Documentation
- **Full revision and reorganization of MANUAL.md.** Six parts, consolidated chapters, standardized terminology, verified all claims against source.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-15
### Fixes
- **Input Quantize / Step Grid Misalignment:** Drum recording now uses midpoint-rounding step windows; Input Quantize correctly rounds to the nearest step boundary across all live recording paths.

## [0.3.7] — 2026-05-14
### Fixes
- **Chord-press monitoring now plays every note.** Simultaneous pad presses no longer drop notes due to set_param coalescing. Live notes batch into a single payload per tick.
- **Drum chord recording lands in one DSP buffer.** Batched into single payload per tick instead of one entry per tick.
- **Drum recording inline-monitors via DSP.** Eliminates duplicate set_param collision on armed-track chord recordings.

## [0.3.6] — 2026-05-14
### Documentation
- **MANUAL.md crash disclaimers softened for Schwung v0.9.13.** External MIDI routing no longer crashes on current Schwung.

### Fixes
- **Drum clip switches keep polyrhythmic lanes in phase.** All launch sites anchor each lane's playhead to its expected position based on elapsed time.

### Features
- **Loop window set via Loop+step range gesture.** Hold Loop + hold a page step + tap another to set loop window. Non-destructive — notes outside window preserved.

### Performance / UX
- **ARP IN latch visual feedback.** Latched pad LEDs stay lit white; Arp chip inverts on OLED.
- **Loop clears latched ARP IN notes without dropping Ltch.**
- **Re-press a latched note to drop it (accumulate mode).**

## [0.3.5] — 2026-05-13
### Features
- **Shift+Step 3 — Edit Synth / Edit Slot shortcut.** One-press co-run entry for the active track's route type.
- **Swing applies to ARP IN, SEQ ARP, and drum repeats with transport stopped.** Live one-shot taps always bypass swing.

### Performance / UX
- **Note/Session button LED blinks during co-run** to advertise exit gesture.

### Fixes
- **Drum step + pad LEDs refresh when switching clips from Session View while stopped.**
- **Drum Rpt1/Rpt2 recording captures sub-step fires.** Multiple hits per step with InQ Off now recorded.
- **Hanging notes during ARP IN chord-changing with swing resolved.** Echoes and deferred offs get per-event swing scheduling.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-12
### Features
- **Euclidean rhythm knob (DRUM LANE K4).** Per-lane Bjorklund hit-count placer that diffs against existing hits.
- **Capture + scene-row button** snapshots current performance into a scene row.
- **Edit Slot... co-run** — hands OLED + jog to Schwung's chain editor (capability-gated to patched Schwung).
- **Edit Synth... co-run** — hands OLED + jog to Move's native device editor (capability-gated to patched Schwung).

### Performance / UX
- **Perf View knob LEDs show looper state; touch toggles looper.**
- **Unified step-entry velocity rule** across drum and melodic tracks.
- **Nudge knob folded onto Shift+K2.** Frees a knob slot on CLIP/DRUM LANE/ALL LANES.
- **Loop and Capture buttons have visible ambient lighting.**
- **Shift+jog in Session View steps active track.**
- **Various knob speed improvements** (Gate 4×, Quantize 2×, step-edit pitch).

### Fixes
- **Shift hint overlay drops on compound modifier press.**
- **Drum-lane step copy flashes source step.**
- **Hanging notes during fast polyphonic live play fixed.**
- **Step-entry velocity consistency** — tapping a step writes fixed vel 100 instead of inheriting stale pad velocity.
- **Shift+Step menu shortcuts target by label** instead of hardcoded indices.
- **MIDI DLY Lvl defaults to 127 on all drum lanes** (was 0 on tracks 1–7).
- **Panic sweeps all 16 MIDI channels on every active route.**

### Persistence
- UI sidecar v=4→v=6: adds per-track Euclidean counts, drumVelZoneArmed, and Schwung-slot assignment.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-11
### Features
- Loop+Play restarts playback from the visible page
- Perf Mode preset mods are individually toggleable; Latch is purely a mode switch
- Perf Mode OLED redesigned with active mod list and footer chips
- Top-row Perf pad LEDs are static (no flashing)

### Fixes
- Removed rec-arm count-in OLED takeover
- Melodic live-recording note-off step-array mirror uses correct rounding

### Performance / UX
- Action popup duration halved (~520ms)
- Step hold-to-save duration shortened (~750ms)

### Documentation
- MANUAL.md rewritten as comprehensive user guide
- Performance Mode appendix updated

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-11

Initial public release.

### Features
- 8 tracks (melodic + drum), 16 clips per track, up to 256 steps per clip
- Per-clip effects chain: TARP, NOTE FX, HARMZ, MIDI DLY, SEQ ARP
- Bake — render the effects chain back into note data (multi-loop, wrap mode)
- Live recording with count-in pre-roll
- 32-lane drum tracks with per-lane loop length, effects, and note repeat
- Scale-aware everything: pitch random, harmonizer, delay, manual transposition

### Known limitations
- External MIDI input into Move-routed tracks crashes Move
- Suspending while a Move-routed drum track is playing can crash Move
- Volume knob briefly interrupts MIDI output
- Powering Move off from within dAVEBOx causes a brief hang
